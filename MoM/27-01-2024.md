# Team - 15: Minutes of the Meeting

## Date: 27 January 2024 - Client Meeting 2

### Feedback from first week

Today we showed our designs in figma, with a simulation. The client liked it but 
addressed a few issues with the icons and how they must be modular and customizable
such that more things can by added on the fly.
We agreed to it but at the same time we explained that the content will be fed dynamically.

We discussed on the profile page and which things should be greyed out and which should be 
editable. While this discussion was going on Mrs. Sriranjini the IT head came through and 
pretty much took over.

### Discussions related to next week

We explained the project to the client head and she was pleased by it, and started talking 
about building an API for IMS backend for content to be served from. We had a 5 minute 
discussion on the scope of it being done and we ended up with the decision that the 
client herself is going to make the API.

We also discussed the scope of the project being only from the student perspective not 
from the staff or faculty perspective.

### Future Tasks

Eventually we decided upon our next plan of action after this, to make the app happen. 
We were given instruction that we were free to code. We discussed about the first 
steps which are authentication and profile fetching.
