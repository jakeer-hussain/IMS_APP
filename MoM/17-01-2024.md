# Team - 15: Minutes of the Meeting

## Date: 17 January 2024 - Client Meeting 1

We met our client for the course project, Ms. Lalitha Gutha, for the first time, to discuss the project and clear out some queries. She said that the motivation behind the project is that the university is planning on migrating the Institute Management System (IMS) on to newer technologies, and would like a mobile application for the same. Hence, we have been given the tak of implementing some functionalities of IMS as a mobile application.

We told of the following basic functionalities to be implemented:
- Login page using CAS authentication
- Dashboard with main options
- Profile page with edit options
- Leave application page for students

We discussed the possibility of adding some additional features to the app if these initial features are implemented.

We also discussed the technology stack to be used and the team suggested that we use React Native to build it, as it is a cross platform framework with support for both Android and iOS applications.

Ms. Gutha gave us our first task, to create some UI design screens for the aforementioned pages, to be shown to her in the next meet, post which we would discuss over the requirements from this project. She also informed that post that, we would be provided the APIs for the backend to start development.
