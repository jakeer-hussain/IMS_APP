# Team - 15: Minutes of the Meeting

## Date: 5 February 2024 - Client Meeting 3

### Feedback from previous week

Previous week we were asked to add bank details and fill the dashboard a bit. We added
the bottom bar and the bank details designs in figma. We changed the profile pages a
bit remove the profile photo. We added back buttons and proper headers for each page.

We also discussed about SRS document and exact requirements of the project. We discussed
the changes required in current draft of the requirements too.

### Discussions related to next week

We discussed, how we will keep the code modular and allow for changes, for example the 
changes required to let the authentication phase decide if the user is student, faculty 
or staff.

### Future Tasks

We also discussed about how the android app is easily transferable and deployable, but
the iOS version of it will not be, and Apple is very closed in terms of app installation,
and sideloading for college level purposes.

We discussed about the API, and how the API should handle multiple requests at different 
times and how scalable the app can be as a whole. We also discussed the possible 
security vulnerabilities and how to encrypt the authentication credentials.
